# 🏡 HomeSecure Chatbot – RAG + Rule-Based Agent System 🧠⚙️

This project is a fully local, offline chatbot system that combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a **rule-based Agent architecture** for decision-making. It uses a static `.txt` knowledge base, vector search with FAISS, and a locally hosted **Mistral 7B** model for generation — no cloud, no APIs, no internet required.
